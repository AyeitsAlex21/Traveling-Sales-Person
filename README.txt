Creation Date: 10/30/21
File Description:  This is the master README. It explains what is in the directory, along with some other information

System Description:
   Our system is composed of 3 modules. Genetic Algorithm, Web Application, and Google Maps API. The purpose of this system is to provide a near-optimal routing algorithm. The program 
   accepts several locations (via a search bar or point-and-click) and will generate a path of minimum distance between the routes, starting from the first location input and ending in 
   the same place. It does so via a genetic algorithm that pulls information from Google Maps.

Subdirectories:
  There are two subdirectories within the master folder:
  1) GenAlgo -- this folder contains all of the files for the genetic algorithm, as well as the google maps API file that makes the actual requests.
  2) webapp -- this folder contains two folders containing all the files of the web application
     i) api -- this folder contains...

TODO:
v. Necessary steps to compile the source code and run the program 
vi. Any additional required setup 
vii. Software dependencies such as the version of the compiler 
viii. A brief description of what is in each subdirectory in the directory structure
